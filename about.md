Hi! My name is Phillip Brooks and I am a dual degree Ph.D. Candidate at Michigan State University in Comparative Medicine and Integrative Biology (CMIB) and Environmental Integrative Toxicological Sciences (EITS). I'm currently working with _Campylobacter jejuni_; a gram-negative bacterial pathogen and leading cause diarrheal illness. My Ph.D. project focuses primarily on two things 1) the role of the microbiota in host immune responses to _Campylobacter jejuni_ infection and, 2) _Campylobacter jejuni_ adaption within the host. I'm in my fifth and final year of my Ph.D.. In the future I plan to do a Post-doc that allows me to combine bioinformatics and host-pathogen interactions. I'm also extremely interested in increasing the number of underrepresented minorities in stem fields, outreach of all kinds, and science policy.
