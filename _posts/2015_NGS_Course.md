Last year I was a participant in the [2014 Next Gen Sequence course](http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2014/) at [Kellogg Biological Station] (http://www.kbs.msu.edu/). After just two short weeks I left amazed and empowered. We covered a vast array of topics from analysis using [amazon cloud services] (https://aws.amazon.com/), genome assembly, mRNASeq, experimental design, open science, etc. The instructors brought great energy and made the course accessible to students at all levels. Upon my return to MSU I eagerly dove into analyzing my own next generation sequencing data and never looked back. 
This summer I had the pleasure of returning to Kellogg Biological station and beautiful gull lake to TA the [course] (http://angus.readthedocs.org/en/2015/).
