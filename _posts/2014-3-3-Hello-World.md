Last year I was a participant in the 2014 Next Gen Sequence course at Kellogg Biological Station. After just two short weeks I left amazed and empowered. We covered a vast array of topics from analysis using amazon cloud services, genome assembly, mRNASeq, experimental design, open science, etc. The instructors brought great energy and made the course accessible to students at all levels. Upon my return to MSU I eagerly dove into analyzing my own next generation sequencing data and never looked back. This summer I had the pleasure of returning to Kellogg Biological station and beautiful gull lake to TA the course.
